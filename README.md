# FYP_auto-mobile_position-forcasting-LSTM-transformers
we are working on focasting problem related to automobile in a cluster and there position and speed prediction w.r.t other automobiles in the cluster or the network
We will also see the task offloading and inter-communication or automobiles with in a cluster.
We will try different Deep-learning approaches like LSTM, bidirectional-LSTM, Attention model, and Tranformers (google-BERT)
